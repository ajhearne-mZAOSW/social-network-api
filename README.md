## Description

18-NoSQL/02-Challenge - Social Network API using MongoDB

This is a RESTful API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, providing a scalable and efficient solution for managing user interactions in a social network.

Project executed in accordance with the following challenge requirements:

### User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

A video showing process for using the application can be found [here.](./assets/Hearne_socialNetworksAPI_Demo.webm)

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using Insomnia. The API provides functionality for:

- Creating and managing users
- Adding, updating, and deleting thoughts
- Adding reactions to thoughts
- Managing user relationships (friend lists)

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating the RESTful API
